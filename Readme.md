Geometric Language & Designs
This repository contains a collection of generative and symbolic design tools, showcasing a blend of artistic expression and code. The project is centered around the ASC3 symbolic language core and the paper3d.py procedural art script, demonstrating how simple logic can create complex and visually compelling geometric patterns.
Project Components
 * asc3 Symbolic Language Core: A Python-based interpreter that allows for the creation of custom ASCII art fonts and rendering text with a command-driven approach. It provides a foundation for creating unique typographical art.
 * paper3d.py: A Python script that generates a 3D grid as a 2D ASCII art output. It uses a custom projection to create a sense of depth and perspective, simulating a "paper-like" geometric design.
How to Get Started
Prerequisites
To run the Python scripts in this repository, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
 * numpy
 * rich
You can install them using pip:
pip install numpy rich

Running the Scripts
 * Run paper3d.py:
   Execute the paper3d.py script from your terminal to generate and display the 3D design directly in the console.
   python paper3d.py

 * Run asc3 Core:
   The asc3 core can be integrated into other applications. The provided script demonstrates how to define a font and render text. You can run the script as is to see an example output.
   python asc3.py

Contributing
We welcome contributions! If you have ideas for new geometric patterns, commands for the asc3 language, or improvements to the code, feel free to open a pull request or an issue.
